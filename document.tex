%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing
%% the biblatex styles.
%%

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting
%% the next command will enable that style.

%% The "title" command has an optional parameter,
%% allowing the author to define a "short title" to be used in page headers.
\title{Extended Abstract: Equationally Correct Operational Semantics}

%%
%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define
%% the authors and their affiliations.
%% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the
%% "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
%% used to denote shared contribution to the research.

%% By default, the full list of authors will be used in the page
%% headers. Often, this list is too long, and will overlap
%% other information printed in the page headers. This command allows
%% the author to define a more concise list
%% of authors' names for this purpose.
